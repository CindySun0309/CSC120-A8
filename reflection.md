Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
It is a class that constructs robots in a game. It has all the methods in the interface, as well as an extra method I created named goback(). This method is called when the undo() method is called. When creating a robot, the user can define its name, height, initial location, and whether or not the robot has hands and wings. The initial energy level for the robot is setted to 10, and if the robot has hands, then there will be 2. 


- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I wrote a goback() method that works similar to the fly() method, and it is called when the user called the undo() method.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It took me a long time to figure out the instruction of this assignment. I asked tutors' help. They also helped me with the very last method undo() because I could not come up with the correct logic.
